<!-- ABOUT ORPHEUS -->
## About OrpheusDL

OrpheusDL is a modular music archival tool written in Python which allows archiving from multiple different services.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of Orpheus up and running:

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+ (due to the requirement of dataclasses), though Python 3.9 is highly recommended

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/OrfiTeam/OrpheusDL.git && cd OrpheusDL
    ```
2. Install all requirements
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the program at least once, or use this command to create the settings file
   ```shell
   python3 orpheus.py settings refresh
   ```
4. Enter your credentials in `config/settings.json`

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Just call `orpheus.py` with any link you want to archive, for example Qobuz:
```shell
python3 orpheus.py https://open.qobuz.com/album/c9wsrrjh49ftb
```

Alternatively do a search (luckysearch to automatically select the first option):
```shell
python3 orpheus.py search qobuz track darkside alan walker
```

Or if you have the ID of what you want to download, use:
```shell
python3 orpheus.py download qobuz track 52151405
```

<!-- CONFIGURATION -->
## Configuration

You can customize every module from Orpheus individually and also set general/global settings which are active in every
loaded module. You'll find the configuration file here: `config/settings.json`

### General Settings

```json5
{
    "download_path": "./downloads/",
    "download_quality": "hifi",
    "search_limit": 10,
    "strict_quality_download": false
}
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `download_path` | string | `"./downloads/"` | Set the absolute or relative output path with `/` as the delimiter |
| `download_quality` | string | `"hifi"` | Choose one of the following settings: `"hifi"`, `"lossless"`, `"high"`, `"medium"`, `"low"` |
| `search_limit` | integer | `10` | How many search results are shown when searching |
| `strict_quality_download` | boolean | `false` | If enabled, tracks will only be downloaded if the requested quality is available |

**Quality Options:**
- **"hifi"**: FLAC higher than 44.1/16 if available
- **"lossless"**: FLAC with 44.1/16 if available  
- **"high"**: lossy codecs such as MP3, AAC, ... in a higher bitrate
- **"medium"**: lossy codecs such as MP3, AAC, ... in a medium bitrate
- **"low"**: lossy codecs such as MP3, AAC, ... in a lower bitrate

**NOTE: The `download_quality` really depends on the used modules, so check out the modules README.md**

### Artist Downloading Settings

#### Artist Downloading Behavior

The following settings control how artist downloads behave:

**Album Filtering:**
- `strict_artist_match`: Only processes albums where the album artist exactly matches the requested artist
- `remove_collectors_editions`: Skips albums with keywords like "collector", "deluxe", "expanded", "bonus", "special", "anniversary", "remastered", "reissue", "limited"
- `remove_live_recordings`: Skips albums with keywords like "live", "concert", "performance", "stage", "tour", "acoustic", "unplugged", "mtv", "bbc", "radio", "session"

**Track Filtering:**
- `ignore_different_artists`: Within albums, skips individual tracks by artists other than the requested artist
- `separate_tracks_skip_downloaded`: Skips separate tracks that have already been downloaded as part of albums

**Examples:**

**Conservative Download (Current Default):**
```json5
{
    "strict_artist_match": true,
    "ignore_different_artists": true,
    "remove_collectors_editions": true,
    "remove_live_recordings": true
}
```
- Only downloads albums by the exact artist
- Only downloads tracks by the exact artist within those albums
- Skips collector editions and live recordings

**Complete Album Download:**
```json5
{
    "strict_artist_match": true,
    "ignore_different_artists": false,
    "remove_collectors_editions": false,
    "remove_live_recordings": false
}
```
- Downloads albums by the exact artist
- Downloads ALL tracks within those albums (including guest features)
- Includes collector editions and live recordings

**Most Permissive:**
```json5
{
    "strict_artist_match": false,
    "ignore_different_artists": false,
    "remove_collectors_editions": false,
    "remove_live_recordings": false
}
```
- Downloads all albums where the artist appears (credited or main)
- Downloads all tracks within those albums
- Includes all types of releases

#### Quality Enforcement Details

When `strict_quality_download` is enabled, the following quality requirements are enforced:

| Quality Setting | Allowed Codecs | Additional Requirements |
|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **lossless** | FLAC, ALAC, WAV | Any bit depth/sample rate |
| **hifi** | FLAC | >16bit OR >44.1kHz sample rate |
| **high** | MP3, AAC, HE-AAC, Vorbis, Opus | â¥256kbps bitrate |
| **medium** | MP3, AAC, HE-AAC, Vorbis, Opus | 128-255kbps bitrate |
| **low** | MP3, AAC, HE-AAC, Vorbis, Opus | <128kbps bitrate |

**Example Error Log Entry:**
```
Strict quality download failed: Requested quality "lossless" unavailable for: Artist Name [123]/Album Name [456]/Track Name [789] (codec: MP3, bitrate: 320, bit_depth: 16, sample_rate: 44.1)
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents downloading tracks that don't meet your quality standards
- Avoids creating empty folders when no tracks meet quality requirements
- Provides detailed logging of failed downloads for review
- Works with all download types: albums, artists, playlists, and individual tracks

### Usage Examples

#### Strict Quality Download Examples

**Example 1: Download only lossless tracks**
```json5
{
    "download_quality": "lossless",
    "strict_quality_download": true
}
```
This will only download FLAC, ALAC, or WAV files. Any MP3, AAC, or other lossy formats will be skipped.

**Example 2: Download only high-quality lossy tracks**
```json5
{
    "download_quality": "high",
    "strict_quality_download": true
}
```
This will only download lossy formats (MP3, AAC, etc.) with bitrates of 256kbps or higher.

**Example 3: Download with quality fallback (default behavior)**
```json5
{
    "download_quality": "lossless",
    "strict_quality_download": false
}
```
This will attempt to download lossless quality but fall back to the best available quality if lossless is not available.

#### Artist Download Examples

**Example 1: Download only studio albums by exact artist**
```json5
{
    "strict_artist_match": true,
    "ignore_different_artists": true,
    "remove_collectors_editions": true,
    "remove_live_recordings": true
}
```

**Example 2: Download complete albums (including guest features)**
```json5
{
    "strict_artist_match": true,
    "ignore_different_artists": false,
    "remove_collectors_editions": false,
    "remove_live_recordings": false
}
```

**Example 3: Download everything the artist appears on**
```json5
{
    "strict_artist_match": false,
    "ignore_different_artists": false,
    "remove_collectors_editions": false,
    "remove_live_recordings": false
}
```

#### Console Output Examples

**When tracks meet quality requirements:**
```
Track 1/10
=== Downloading track Track Name (123456) ===
        Album: Album Name (789)
        Artists: Artist Name (456)
        Codec: FLAC, bitrate: 1411kbps, bit depth: 16bit, sample rate: 44.1kHz
        Downloading track file
        === Track 123456 downloaded ===
```

**When tracks fail quality requirements:**
```
Track 1/10
        Strict quality download failed: Requested quality "lossless" unavailable for: Artist [123]/Album [456]/Track [789] (codec: MP3, bitrate: 320, bit_depth: 16, sample_rate: 44.1)
=== Track 789 failed due to strict quality requirements ===
```

**When tracks are skipped due to artist filtering:**
```
Track 1/10
        Track is not from the correct artist, skipping
```

**When albums are filtered out:**
```
Skipping collector edition: Album Name (Deluxe Edition)
Skipping live recording: Album Name (Live)
Skipping different artist: Album Name (by Different Artist)
```

#### Troubleshooting

**Q: Why are all my tracks being skipped?**
A: Check your `download_quality` setting and ensure the tracks are actually available in that quality. Some older releases may only be available in lossy formats.

**Q: Where can I find details about failed downloads?**
A: Failed downloads are logged to `strict_quality_errors.log` in the same directory where you run OrpheusDL.

**Q: Can I use strict quality with any download type?**
A: Yes, strict quality download works with albums, artists, playlists, and individual tracks.

**Q: Will folders be created if no tracks meet quality requirements?**
A: No, folders and cover art are only created when at least one track will be downloaded.

**Q: Why are some tracks being skipped during artist downloads?**
A: Check your `ignore_different_artists` setting. If enabled, tracks by other artists within albums will be skipped.

**Q: How do I download complete albums with guest features?**
A: Set `ignore_different_artists` to `false` to download all tracks within albums, including guest appearances.
